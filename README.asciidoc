== ITP Processing to OF examples == +

The original Processing sketches are included in the project folders or within the .cpp files.  +

If you are having trouble running the sketch, it is probably the folder structure. A quick way to fix it is to just create a new project and copy the .h and .cpp files into your project.  +
