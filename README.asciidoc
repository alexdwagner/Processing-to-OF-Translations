== ITP Processing to OF examples ==

The original Processing sketches are included in the project folders. 

notes: 
the ASCIIVideo example in OF is the same as the one in Processing
Jeff Crouse has some good translations for Dan Shiffman's Nature of Code example. His link s are down for now, will update when he puts them back up.
